Cluster Visualization - Created a complete visualization system with 4 different plot types showing cluster formation, timeline, trust metrics, and performance analysis

Trust-Based Clustering - Fully integrated the trust system with clustering algorithms, achieving 100% malicious node detection and ensuring only trustworthy vehicles become cluster heads

Message Delivery Bug - Fixed the critical bug where messages weren't being received by correcting the timestamp to use simulation time instead of system time
