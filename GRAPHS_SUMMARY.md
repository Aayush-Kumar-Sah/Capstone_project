## 📊 What Each Graph Proves

### Graph 1: **Transparency ✓**
"Trust calculation is now fully transparent with explicit formula"

### Graph 2: **Consensus ✓**
"Election changed from selection to true democratic voting"

### Graph 3: **Security ✓**
"System detects strategic sleeper agents proactively"

### Graph 4: **Performance ✓**
"Improvements don't sacrifice performance"

### Graph 5: **Dynamic ✓**
"Social trust updates in real-time based on interactions"

### Graph 6: **Integration ✓**
"All improvements work together in layered architecture"

## 📝 Sample LaTeX Figure Code

```latex
\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{graph2_election_mechanism.png}
\caption{Evolution of cluster head election mechanism. 
(a) Previous 5-metric complex scoring. 
(b) Proposed simplified 2-metric scoring (60\% trust, 40\% resource). 
(c) Previous weighted selection where highest score wins automatically. 
(d) Proposed true consensus voting requiring 51\% majority threshold with fallback to highest score.}
